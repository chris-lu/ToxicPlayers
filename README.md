ToxicPlayer is a Elder Scrolls Online social addon that enables you to spot ignored players more easily in the game by changing the reticle style.
You'll then be able to focus your foes on the battle fields, not help the players ignored in your faction and even spot your friends or guild mates if they're not grouped with you. 
You can as well easily add target players to your ignore list (ideal for PvP T-baggers) and report players using exploits or bots for example.


Ignored players will be red marked, muted players (if you're using MuteList addon) will be orange displayed, friends players will be marked as green and guild mates (deactivated by default) will be shown in blue.

Now, you'll always remember your enemies.
