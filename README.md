# ToxicPlayers - Elder Scrolls Online Addon

ToxicPlayers is a social addon for **The Elder Scrolls Online (ESO)** that enhances your gameplay by making it easier to identify ignored players, friends, guildmates, and muted players.

With this addon, you can:
- Spot ignored players by changing the **reticle style**.
- Avoid unintentionally helping ignored players in PvP or PvE.
- Quickly add players to your ignore list (ideal for **PvP T-baggers**).
- Report players exploiting the game or using bots.
- Recognize **friends and guildmates** who are not grouped with you.

## Features
- **Visual markers** near the crosshair for different player types:
  - **Ignored players** → Red marker
  - **Friends** → Green marker
  - **Guild mates** (disabled by default) → Blue marker
- **Single key press** to:
  - Add the targeted player to your ignore list.
  - Open the "Report Player" form for the targeted player.
  - Display information about the last encountered player (friend, guildmate, muted, or ignored).
