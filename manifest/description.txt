ToxicPlayer is a tiny social addon that enables you to spot ignored players more easily in the game by changing the reticle style.
You'll then be able to focus your foes on the battle fields, not help the players ignored in your faction and even spot your friends if they're not grouped with you. 


Ignored players will be red marked, muted players (if you're using [URL="http://www.esoui.com/downloads/info1061-MutePlayer.html"]MuteList[/URL] addon) will be orange displayed and friends players will be marked as green.

Now, you'll always remember your ennemies.
